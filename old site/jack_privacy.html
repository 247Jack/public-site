Cookies and IP Addresses<br>
Jack Automation Technologies, Inc. is firmly committed to our customers' privacy. Like many sites, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and provide a better web experience. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your order and gather general demographic information. We don't use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart.

We do not and cannot use cookies or tokens to gather your confidential information that may be stored on your device.

Your Personal Information<br>
We collect your contact information, including, but not limited to, name, email addresses, phone number, and financial information. Collected information is used for the benefit of Jack Automation Technologies, Inc. to send information to customers and clients about orders, to fulfill orders, to process and collect payments, and to contact customers about orders when necessary.

Email Preferences<br>
We communicate with you via email only when needed. Stripe (a third party provider) uses your email to send you receipts of your transactions. We call these transactional emails and they provide proof of payment for an order. We also use your email to communicate with you about specific information such as beta opportunities or ask questions about a transaction or your business account with us. If you would like to be removed from email communication other than transactional emails, send us a message to hi@247jack.com and we will be glad to help you.
<br>
<br>
Third-Party Service Providers<br>
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include sending announcement e-mails and processing credit card payments. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Customer information is considered to be an asset of Jack Automation Technologies, Inc. and as such may be transferred to another company as part of an acquisition of Jack Automation Technologies, Inc..
<br>
<br>
Information Security<br>
We have instituted reasonable safeguards to help ensure that information collected is secure. We also take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties who work with us to make the application, or service provided on kashir agree to protect personal information that they must access in order to serve you and to honor your preferences about contacts you receive.
<br>
<br>
When you send or otherwise transmit your sensitive information (such as your credit card number) to or through Jack Automation Technologies, Inc., your sensitive information is encrypted and protected with SSL, the current industry-standard encryption protocol. When you are on an SSL-protected page, a picture of a closed lock appears at the bottom or top of some web browsers. Another way to tell if you are on a secure page is to check the URL or address of the page. (Look in the address box or right-click on the page and select "Properties".) These secure SSL-encrypted pages have URLs that start with "https://" instead of "http://".
<br>
<br>
Please understand, however, that it is possible for third parties to access information despite our efforts. Without limiting the terms of our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, you understand that we do not guarantee that your use of the service and/or information provided by you will be private or secure and we are not responsible or liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience.
